# YetiDB

YetiDB is a Golang project that provides an interface for interacting with a database using the Protocol Buffers data format.

## Structure

The project consists of multiple Go files, each serving a specific purpose:

1. `driver.go`: This file defines the `Driver` interface for database operations, which includes configuring the driver, creating a new session, and closing a session.

2. `session.go`: This file defines the `Session` interface, which has methods to execute transactions and close a session.

3. `transaction.go`: This file defines the `Transaction` interface, which includes methods to read, write, commit, rollback, and close a transaction.

4. `result.go`: This file defines the `Result` interface, which includes methods to handle errors, retrieve current and next records, and collect all records.

5. `protojson.go`: This file defines the `JSONRecord` struct and methods to serialize and deserialize JSON data to and from Protocol Buffers messages.

6. `driver_config.go`: This file defines the `DriverConfig` struct, which can be used to configure the database driver.

7. `placeholder.go`: This file is a placeholder and does not contain any code.

## Dependencies

YetiDB relies on the following dependencies:

- `github.com/golang/protobuf v1.5.3`
- `google.golang.org/protobuf v1.26.0`

## Usage

To use YetiDB, you need to implement the `Driver` interface defined in `driver.go` for your specific database. Then, you can create a new session, execute transactions, and handle results as per your requirements.

## Note

1. This is a basic overview of the YetiDB project. For more detailed information, you should look into the individual Go files mentioned above.
2. This file was generated by Chat-GPT. It's pretty spot-on.
